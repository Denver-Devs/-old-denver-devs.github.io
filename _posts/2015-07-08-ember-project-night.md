This is the premier Project Night for the Denver Emburritos. This meetup is for everyone: those who just have questions about Ember, those who want to get started with Ember and anyone working on an Ember project that just wants a collaborative place to code. There won't be any food or drinks, but there will be plenty of brain stimulation. Hope to see you there!
