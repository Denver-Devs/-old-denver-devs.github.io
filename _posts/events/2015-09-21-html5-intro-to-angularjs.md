"A Practical Introduction to AngularJS" by Dr. Venkat Subramaniam
What’s a better way to learn about a library than actually building an application with it? In this all live-coding, zero powerpoint presentation, we will take up an application and build it using AngularJS. Along the way, we will learn about various aspects of this wonderful library, it’s capabilities, strengths, and good practices.
At the end of this session you will learned how to be hands on and create your own applications with Angular.


"Automated Testing AngularJS: From the Ground Up" by Dr. Venkat Subramaniam
When it comes to automated testing, there are haves and have-nots. That is those who have the discipline and those who don’t—to perform automated testing. Many have given uncountable excuses as to why JavaScript related projects can’t be automated tested. But, those are just that excuses.
In this presentation, we will take a step-by-step approach to creating an application fully test driven. Instead of taking theory, we will quickly get into the nitty gritty details of automated testing through a practical example, get into a bit of complexity, and resolve our way with effective and practical testing techniques. 
After this session, you will be able to automated your projects and also help convince those out there who still need convincing.
