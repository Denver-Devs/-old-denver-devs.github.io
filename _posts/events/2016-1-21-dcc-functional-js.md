## Nodeschool - Functional JavaScript Workshop
This week we'll take a look at one of the more abstract programming topics, functional programming, and how it can be applied to JavaScript. Guest speaker Talon Poole will give us a brief introduction to the core concepts and then we'll pair up and start tackling Nodeschool's Functional JavaScript Workshop.
