## Whats going on in JavaScript Land? (20min)
We'll be talking about new/exciting things going on in the industry. If you have something you think we should mention, feel free to tweet us @DenverScript.

## Lightning Talks (10min each):
Got some cool, freaking awesome JavaScript thing you want to share with the WORLD!? Then hit me up with your idea and we'll turn you into a JavaScript Rockstar\*. Just fill out the form :D
\*We guarantee you'll be a rockstar in your own mind but not in the community. Results may vary.

## Socialize:
We'll have beer and pizza! We'll also allow people to announce any job opportunities they may have at that time so you can socialize with potential applicants.
