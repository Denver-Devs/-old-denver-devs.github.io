## Hands-On React.js - Introduction & Hack Night
New to React? Guest speaker, Will Klein, will give an intro session and a mini-workshop to show you the ropes. Afterwards, we'll break into two groups: One to hack away on some React projects together and one to work through the Nodeschool learnyoureact elective.
