# The Manifesto.
Develop Denver is built on the idea that by bringing the community of designers, developers, and those involved in creating together, we can learn, share, and create better things. 
The conference is completely community driven, from panelists submitting talks, and registered attendees voting on which ones they want to see and learn about. 
Develop Denver is not limited to just Colorado, it is a conference for everyone from anywhere to join.
